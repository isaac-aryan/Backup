How to Install Node.js on a Mac
Node.js is required for using many JavaScript tools and for creating server-side JavaScript applications. Here is how you install Node.js on a Mac.

The first thing you should do is check to see if you have a version of Node.js already installed. To do that:

Open the Terminal by pressing Command+Space to open Spotlight Search and entering Terminal then pressing Enter.
Enter node - v in the Terminal and press Enter.
Nats-MacBook-Pro:Webucator natdunn$ node -v
If you do have Node.js installed, it will output the version.
Update to the latest version using npm i -g npm. If you get a bunch of checkPermissions warnings, you should run the command as the superuser like this: sudo npm i -g npm
You now have the latest version installed. You do not need to continue with these instructions.
If you do not have Node.js installed, it will output something like -bash: node: command not found. Continue with these instructions to install it.
